comment: This type of herbicides are taken up by plant root and leaf tissue and transported to the meristems via both phloem and xylem. The herbicide stops the activity of the enzyme, acetolactate synthase (ALS), which is involved in branch chain amino acid (valine, leucine and isoleucine) synthesis.
